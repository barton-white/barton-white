- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @barton-white
- ğŸ‘€ I do front end development, Wordpress, and sometimes fullstack Node with React. I'm a big fan of JAM stack as well.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PWA's and integrating AI
- ğŸ“« My portfolio is at https://bartonwhite.me (built with Gatsby btw)
- This profile is quiet because I mainly use @bartonPollinate for work and some of my personal stuff gets lumped under there sometimes.
